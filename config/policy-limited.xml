<!--
  Creating a security policy that fits your specific local environment
  before making use of ImageMagick is highly advised. You can find guidance on
  setting up this policy at https://imagemagick.org/script/security-policy.php,
  and it's important to verify your policy using the validation tool located
  at https://imagemagick-secevaluator.doyensec.com/.


  Limited ImageMagick security policy:

  The primary objective of the limited security policy is to find a
  middle ground between convenience and security. This policy involves the
  deactivation of potentially hazardous functionalities, like specific coders
  such as SVG or HTTP. Furthermore, it establishes several constraints on
  the utilization of resources like memory, storage, and processing duration,
  all of which are adjustable. This policy proves advantageous in situations
  where there's a need to mitigate the potential threat of handling possibly
  malicious or demanding images, all while retaining essential capabilities
  for prevalent image formats.
