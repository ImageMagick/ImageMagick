<!--
  Creating a security policy that fits your specific local environment
  before making use of ImageMagick is highly advised. You can find guidance on
  setting up this policy at https://imagemagick.org/script/security-policy.php,
  and it's important to verify your policy using the validation tool located
  at https://imagemagick-secevaluator.doyensec.com/.


  Web-safe ImageMagick security policy:

  This security protocol designed for web-safe usage focuses on situations
  where ImageMagick is applied in publicly accessible contexts, like websites.
  It deactivates the capability to read from or write to any image formats
  other than web-safe formats like GIF, JPEG, and PNG. Additionally, this
  policy prohibits the execution of image filters and indirect reads, thereby
  thwarting potential security breaches. By implementing these limitations,
  the web-safe policy fortifies the safeguarding of systems accessible to
  the public, reducing the risk of exploiting ImageMagick's capabilities
  for potential attacks.
