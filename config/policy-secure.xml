<!--
  Creating a security policy that fits your specific local environment
  before making use of ImageMagick is highly advised. You can find guidance on
  setting up this policy at https://imagemagick.org/script/security-policy.php,
  and it's important to verify your policy using the validation tool located
  at https://imagemagick-secevaluator.doyensec.com/.


  Secure ImageMagick security policy:

  This stringent security policy prioritizes the implementation of
  rigorous controls and restricted resource utilization to establish a
  profoundly secure setting while employing ImageMagick. It deactivates
  conceivably hazardous functionalities, including specific coders like
  SVG or HTTP. The policy promotes the tailoring of security measures to
  harmonize with the requirements of the local environment and the guidelines
  of the organization. This protocol encompasses explicit particulars like
  limitations on memory consumption, sanctioned pathways for reading and
  writing, confines on image sequences, the utmost permissible duration of
  workflows, allocation of disk space intended for image data, and even an
  undisclosed passphrase for remote connections. By adopting this robust
  policy, entities can elevate their overall security stance and alleviate
  potential vulnerabilities.
