%  Import is an X Window System window dumping utility.  Import allows X
%  users to store window images in a specially formatted dump file.  This
%  file can then be read by the Display utility for redisplay, printing,
%  editing, formatting, archiving, image processing, etc.  The target
%  window can be specified by id or name or be selected by clicking the
%  mouse in the desired window.  The keyboard bell is rung once at the
%  beginning of the dump and twice when the dump is completed.
