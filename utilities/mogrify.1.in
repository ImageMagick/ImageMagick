\fBmagick mogrify\fP [\fIoptions\fP] \fIinput-file\fP 
.SH OVERVIEW
The \fBmogrify\fP program is a member of the ImageMagick(1) suite of tools.  Use it to resize an image, blur, crop, despeckle, dither, draw on, flip, join, re-sample, and much more. This tool is similar to convert(1) except the original image file is overwritten with any changes you request.
