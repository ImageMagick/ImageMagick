In addition to those listed above, you can specify these standard X resources as command line options:  \-background, \-bordercolor, \-borderwidth, \-font, \-foreground, \-iconGeometry, \-iconic, \-mattecolor, \-name, \-shared-memory, \-usePixmap, or \-title.

By default, the image format of `file' is determined by its magic number.  To specify a particular image format, precede the filename with an image format name and a colon (i.e. ps:image) or specify the image type as the filename suffix (i.e. image.ps).  Specify 'file' as '-' for standard input or output.

Buttons: 
  1    press to map or unmap the Command widget
  2    press and drag to magnify a region of an image
  3    press to load an image from a visual image directory
.SH NOTE
The display program defaults to the X screen resolution.  To display vector formats at their intended size, override the default resolution:
