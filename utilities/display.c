%  Display is a machine architecture independent image processing
%  and display program.  It can display any image in the MIFF format on
%  any workstation display running X.  Display first determines the
%  hardware capabilities of the workstation.  If the number of unique
%  colors in the image is less than or equal to the number the workstation
%  can support, the image is displayed in an X window.  Otherwise the
%  number of colors in the image is first reduced to match the color
%  resolution of the workstation before it is displayed.
%
%  This means that a continuous-tone 24 bits-per-pixel image can display on a
%  8 bit pseudo-color device or monochrome device.  In most instances the
%  reduced color image closely resembles the original.  Alternatively, a
%  monochrome or pseudo-color image can display on a continuous-tone 24
%  bits-per-pixel device.
