In addition to those listed above, you can specify these standard X resources as command line options:  \-background, \-bordercolor, \-borderwidth, \-font, \-mattecolor, or \-title.

By default, the image format of `file' is determined by its magic number.  To specify a particular image format, precede the filename with an image format name and a colon (i.e. ps:image) or specify the image type as the filename suffix (i.e. image.ps).  Specify 'file' as '-' for standard input or output.
