.SH NAME
identify \- describes the format and characteristics of one or more image files.
.SH SYNOPSIS
.TP
\fBidentify\fP [\fIoptions\fP] \fIinput-file\fP
.SH OVERVIEW
The \fBidentify\fP program is a member of the ImageMagick(1) suite of tools.  It describes the format and characteristics of one or more image files. It also reports if an image is incomplete or corrupt. The information returned includes the image number, the file name, the width and height of the image, whether the image is colormapped or not, the number of colors in the image (by default off use \fI-define unique=true\fP option), the number of bytes in the image, the format of the image (JPEG, PNM, etc.), and finally the number of seconds it took to read and process the image. Many more attributes are available with the verbose option.

  \-virtual-pixel method
                       virtual pixel access method

Image Operators:
  \-grayscale method    convert image to grayscale
  \-negate              replace each pixel with its complementary color 

Miscellaneous Options:
  \-debug events        display copious debugging information
  \-help                print program options
  \-list type           print a list of supported option arguments
  \-log format          format of debugging information
  \-version             print version information

By default, the image format of `file' is determined by its magic number.  To specify a particular image format, precede the filename with an image format name and a colon (i.e. ps:image) or specify the image type as the filename suffix (i.e. image.ps).  Specify 'file' as '-' for standard input or output.
.SH NOTE
Although some options appear to modify the file to be identified, the identify command is strictly \fBread only\fP. For instance, the crop option crops the in-memory image and then describes the result.
