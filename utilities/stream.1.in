\fBstream\fP [\fIoptions\fP] \fIinput-file\fP \fIoutput-file\fP
.SH OVERVIEW
\fBStream\fP is a lightweight tool to stream one or more pixel components of the image or portion of the image to your choice of storage formats.  It writes the pixel components as they are read from the input image a row at a time making \fBstream\fP desirable when working with large images or when you require raw pixel components.

By default, the image format of `file' is determined by its magic number.  To specify a particular image format, precede the filename with an image format name and a colon (i.e. ps:image) or specify the image type as the filename suffix (i.e. image.ps).  Specify 'file' as '-' for standard input or output.
