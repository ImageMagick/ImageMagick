These active developers and have made source code contributions to the
ImageMagick project in the last few years:

Cristy
     Principal architect of ImageMagick and still maintains the ImageMagick
     distribution.

Dirk Lemstra
     Contributor to and maintainer of Magick++, OpenCL acceleration, and
     the Windows build (configure, ImageMagickObject, etc.).

Glenn Randers-Pehrson
     Contributed significantly to the utilities.  Authored support for JNG,
     MNG, and PNG formats. Provided significant support for the BMP format.
     Made significant improvements to the documentation.

Bastien ROUCARIÃˆS
     Various patches from Debian downstream.

Fred Weinhaus
     Contributed support and documentation for the discrete Fourier transform,
     connected component labeling, perceptual hash, kuwahara filter and others.
     Also provides scripts that perform some out-of-the ordinary image
     processing operations @ http://www.fmwconcepts.com/imagemagick/.  He
     utilized his scripts as unit tests for ImageMagick version 7 to ensure
     version 6 compatibility before its release.

     algorithm, and minor rendering improvements.

Christopher R. Hawks
     Authored the PALM coder.

Rick Mabry

     and major improvements to the web page (both content and appearance).

Catalin Mihaila
     Contributed a ZX-Spectrum SCREEN$ reader.

Chantal Racette, Laurentian University
     Sped up Sinc and Blackman filter kernels. EWA resampling code
     verification.

     Author of FlashPix module. Author of the EMF, XTRN, and META coders.
     Significant contributions to the MSL, JPEG, TIFF, SVG, and URL coders.
     Authored "process" module support. Wrote the micro-timer facility used
     by 'identify'. Ported module loader support to Windows. Significantly
     improved polygon rendering performance.

Nicolas Robidoux, Laurentian University
     New ellipse clamping method and vertical/horizontal line preserving
     filters for EWA resampling. Sped up resampling filter kernels.

Leonard Rosenthol
     Authored the 'conjure' utility and associated MSL execution environment.
     Provided MacOS support. Authored the CLIPBOARD, XCF, and PSD coders.
     Postscript and PDF expertise. Significant drawing enhancements including
     support for dash patterns, linecap stroking, clipping masks and a
     mask image.

Kyle Shorter
     Original author of PerlMagick.  Author of the LOCALE coder.

Lars Ruben Skyum
     Contributed the -clippath functionality, improved color profile support,
     and re-wrote the PS3 coder.

Anthony Thyssen
     Designed the ImageMagick 6.0 command line processing with parenthesis,
     image sequence operators, and GIF animation processing.  Wrote the
     image perspective distortions (-distort) and resampling methods.
     Maintains a comprehensive set of examples of using ImageMagick at
     http://www.imagemagick.org/Usage/.

Milan Votava
     Contributed support for Wireless BitMap, used in WAP - Wireless Access
     Protocol.


We acknowledge these non-developer contributors to the ImageMagick project:

Rod Bogart and John W. Peterson, University of Utah
     Image compositing is loosely based on rlecomp of the Utah Raster Toolkit.

Thomas R Crimmins
     Inventor of the eight hull algorithm used for speckle reduction.

Michael Halle, Spatial Imaging Group at MIT
     Contributed the initial implementation of Alan Paeth's image rotation
     algorithm.

Paul Heckbert, Carnegie Mellon University
     Image resizing is loosely based on Paul Heckbert's Zoom program.

Peder Langlo, Hewlett Packard
     Made hundreds of suggestions and bug reports. Without Peder, this
     software would not be nearly as useful as it is today.

David Pensak, E. I. du Pont de Nemours and Company
     For providing the computing environment that made developing ImageMagick
     possible.

Paul Raveling, USC Information Sciences Institute
     The spatial subdivision color reduction algorithm is based on his
     Img software.

Alvy Ray Smith and Eric Ray Lyons
     HWB color transform and algorithm.

Alexander Zimmermann
     Responsible for the ImageMagick Linux binary distributions for many years.
     His efforts are very much appreciated.
