#  Given a version number MAJOR.MINOR.MICRO-PATCH, increment the:
#
#  1. MAJOR version for incompatible API changes,
#  2. MINOR version when MICRO version exceeds 15 e.g. 0x70F becomes 0x710
#  3. MICRO version for added functionality in backwards compatible

#  4. PATCH version when you make backwards compatible bug fixes.

#  Additional labels for pre-release and build metadata are available as

# If the library source code has changed at all since the last update,
# increment revision (‘c:r:a’ becomes ‘c:r+1:a’).  If any interfaces have been
# added, removed, or changed since the last update, increment current, and set
# revision to 0.  If any interfaces have been added since the last public
# release, then increment age.  If any interfaces have been removed or changed
# since the last public release, then set age to 0.
#
# PLEASE NOTE that doing a SO BUMP aka raising the CURRENT REVISION
# could be avoided using libversioning aka map files.  You MUST change .map
# files if you raise these versions.
#
# Bump the minor release # whenever there is an SOVersion bump.
