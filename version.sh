# Here are a set of rules to help you update your library version
# information:
#
#   If there is any interface change, increment CURRENT (major).  If that
#   interface change does not break upward compatibility (i.e. it is an
#   addition), increment AGE (micro), Otherwise AGE is reset to 0. If CURRENT
#   has changed, REVISION (minor) is set to 0, otherwise REVISION is
#   incremented.
