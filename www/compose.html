<p class="lead magick-description">This page descibed the Image composition methods that is used to define how
two images should be merged together in various image operations.  For the
Command Line API it is typically set using the <a
href="https://www.imagemagick.org/script/command-line-options.html#compose" >-compose</a> setting option. </p>


<p>The description of composition uses abstract terminology in order to allow
the description to be more precise, while avoiding constant values which are
specific to a particular build configuration. Each image pixel is represented
by red, green, and blue levels (which are equal for a gray pixel). The
build-dependent value <var>QuantumRange</var> is the maximum integral
value which may be stored, per pixel, in the red, green, or blue channels of
the image. Each image pixel may also optionally (if the image matte channel is
enabled) have an associated level of opacity, ranging from <var>opaque</var> to
<var>transparent</var>, which may be used to determine the influence of the pixel
color when compositing the pixel with another image pixel. If the image matte
channel is disabled, then all pixels in the image are treated as opaque. The
color of an opaque pixel is fully visible while the color of a transparent
pixel color is entirely absent (pixel color is ignored).</p>

<p>By definition, raster images have a rectangular shape. All image rows are of
equal length, as are all image columns. By treating the alpha channel as a
visual "mask" the rectangular image may be given a "shape" by treating the
alpha channel as a cookie-cutter for the image. This is done by setting the
pixels within the shape to be opaque, with pixels outside the shape set as
transparent. Pixels on the boundary of the shape may be between opaque and
transparent in order to provide antialiasing (visually smooth edges). The
description of the composition operators use this concept of image "shape" in
order to make the description of the operators easier to understand. While it
is convenient to describe the operators in terms of "shapes" they are by no
means limited to mask-style operations since they are based on continuous
floating-point mathematics rather than simple boolean operations.</p>

<p>The following alpha blending (Duff-Porter) compose methods are available:</p>

  </tr>

  </tbody>
</table>

<p>Any of the 'Src-*' methods can also be specified without the 'Src-' part.
For example the default compose method can be specified as just 'Over'.</p>

<p>Many of these compose methods will clear the destination image which was
not overlaid by the source image.  This is to be expected as part of that
specific composition methods defintion. You can disable this by setting the
special <a href="https://www.imagemagick.org/script/command-line-options.html#define"
>-define</a> 'compose:outside-overlay' to a value of 'false' will turn off
this behavior. </p>

<p>On top of the above 12 Duff-Porter Alpha Composition methods, one special
related method '<code>Copy</code>' has been provided. This is equivalent to
using the '<code>Src</code>'  with the special <a href="https://www.imagemagick.org/script/command-line-options.html#define"
>-define</a> option '<code>compose:outside-overlay</code>' set to
'<code>false</code>', so as to only modify the overlaid area, without clearing
the rest of the image outside the overlaid area.  </p>

<p>The following mathematical composition methods are also available. </p>

<p>Typically these use the default 'Over' alpha blending when transparencies
are also involved, except for 'Plus' which uses a 'plus' alpha blending.  This
means the alpha channel  of both images will only be used to ensure that any
visible input remains visible even in parts not overlaid. It also means that
any values are weighted by the alpha channel of the input and output images.
This 'Over' alpha blending is also applied to the lighting composition methods
below. </p>

<p>As of IM v6.6.1-6, if the special '<code>Sync</code>' flag is not specified
(enabled by default) with the <a href="https://www.imagemagick.org/script/command-line-options.html#channel"
>-channel</a> setting, then the above mathematical compositions will nolonger
synchronise its actions with the alpha channel.  Instead the math composition
will be applied on an individual channel basis as defined by the <a
href="https://www.imagemagick.org/script/command-line-options.html#channel"
>-channel</a>.  This includes the alpha channel. This special usage
allows you to perform true mathematics of the image channels, without alpha
composition effects, becoming involved. </p>

<p>This special flag is not applied to the lighting composition methods (see
below) even though they are closely related to mathematical composition
methods.</p>

<p>The following lighting composition methods are also available. </p>

</table>

<p>On top of these composed methods are a few special ones that not only require
the two images that are being merged or overlaid, but have some extra numerical
arguments, which are tabled below. </p>

<p>In the "<code>composite</code>" command these composition methods are
selected using special options with the arguments needed. They are usually,
but not always, the same name as the composite 'method' they use, and replaces
the normal use of the <a href="https://www.imagemagick.org/script/command-line-options.html#compose" >-compose</a>
setting in the "<code>composite</code>" command.  For example... </p>

<pre>
composite ... -blend 50x50 ...
</pre>

<p>As of IM v6.5.3-4 the "<code>convert</code>" command can now also supply
these extra arguments to its <a href="https://www.imagemagick.org/script/command-line-options.html#composite"
>-composite</a> operator, using the special <a href="https://www.imagemagick.org/script/command-line-options.html#define">-define</a>
attribute of '<code class="arg">compose:args</code>'.  This means you can now
make use of these special augmented <a href="https://www.imagemagick.org/script/command-line-options.html#compose"
>-compose</a> methods, those the argument and the method both need to be set
separately.  For example... </p>

<pre>
convert ... -compose blend  -define compose:args=50,50 -composite ...
</pre>

<p>The following is a table of these special 'argumented' compose methods,
with a brief summary of what they do. For more details see the equivalent
"composite" command option name.  </p>

    <br/>Equivalent to "<code>composite</code>" <a href="https://www.imagemagick.org/script/command-line-options.html#dissolve">-dissolve</a>
    <br/>Dissolve the 'source' image by the percentage given before overlaying
        'over' the 'destination' image. If <var>src_percent</var> is
        greater than 100, it starts dissolving the main image so it will
        become transparent at a value of '<code class="arg">200</code>'.  If
        both percentages are given, each image are dissolved to the
        percentages given.
    </td>

  <tr>

    <br/>Average the images together ('plus') according to the percentages
        given and each pixels transparency.  If only a single percentage value
        is given it sets the weight of the composite or 'source' image, while
        the background image is weighted by the exact opposite amount. That is
        a <code>-blend 30</code> merges 30% of the 'source' image with 70% of
        the 'destination' image.  Thus it is equivalent to <code>-blend
        30x70</code>.
    </td>
  </tr>

  <tr>
    <td>mathematics</td>
    <td>Arguments: <var>A, B, C, D</var>
    <br/>Not available in "<code>composite</code>" at this time.
    <br/>Merge the source and destination images according to the formula
    <br/>     <code>A*Sc*Dc + B*Sc + C*Dc + D</code>
    <br/>Can be used to generate a custom composition method that would
        otherwise need to be implemented using the slow <a
        href="https://www.imagemagick.org/script/command-line-options.html#fx">-fx</a> DIY image operator.   Added
        to ImageMagick version 6.5.4-3.
    <br/>As of IM v6.6.1-6 this method will do per-channel math compositions
        if the 'Sync' flag is removed from <a
        href="https://www.imagemagick.org/script/command-line-options.html#channel" >-channel</a>, just like all
        the other mathematical composition methods above.

    <td>modulate</td>
    <td>Arguments:

    <br/>Equivalent to "<code>composite</code>" <a href="https://www.imagemagick.org/script/command-line-options.html#watermark">-watermark</a>
    <br/>Take a grayscale image (with alpha mask) and modify the destination
        image's brightness according to watermark image's grayscale value and
        the <var>brightness</var> percentage.  The destinations
        color saturation attribute is just direct modified by the <var>saturation</var> percentage, which defaults to 100 percent
        (no color change).

    <br/>Equivalent to "<code>composite</code>" <a href="https://www.imagemagick.org/script/command-line-options.html#displace">-displace</a>
    <br/>With this option, the 'overlay' image, and optionally the 'mask'
        image, is used as a relative displacement map, which is used to
        displace the lookup of what part of the destination image is seen at
        each point of the overlaid area.  Much like the displacement map is a
        'lens' that distorts the original 'background' image behind it.
    <br/><br/>
        The X-scale is modulated by the 'red' channel of the overlay image
        while the Y-scale is modulated by the green channel, (the mask image
        if given is rolled into green channel of the overlay image. This
        separation allows you to modulate the X and Y lookup displacement
        separately allowing you to do 2-dimensional displacements, rather
        than 1-dimensional vectored displacements (using grayscale image).
    <br/><br/>
        If the overlay image contains transparency this is used as a mask
        of the resulting image to remove 'invalid' pixels.
    <br/><br/>
        The '%' flag makes the displacement scale relative to the size of the
        overlay image (100% = half width/height of image). Using '!' switches

    <td>Arguments:
        <var>X-scale</var>[x<var>Y-scale</var>[+<var>X-center</var>+<var>Y-center</var>]][!][%]
    <br/>Not available in "<code>composite</code>" at this time.
    <br/>Exactly as per 'Displace' (above), but using absolute coordinates,
        relative to the center of the overlay (or that given).  Basically
        allows you to generate absolute distortion maps where 'black' will
        look up the left/top edge, and 'white' looks up the bottom/right
        edge of the destination image, according to the scale given.
    <br/><br/>
        The '!' flag not only switches percentage scaling, to use the
        destination image, but also the image the center offset of the lookup.
        This means the overlay can lookup a completely different region of the
        destination image.

    <td>blur</td>
    <td>Arguments:
        <var>Width</var>[x<var>Height</var>[+<var>Angle</var>][+<var>Angle2</var>]]
    <br/>Equivalent to "<code>composite</code>" <a href="https://www.imagemagick.org/script/command-line-options.html#blur-composite">-blur</a>
    <br/>A Variable Blur Mapping Composition method, where each pixel in the
        overlaid region is replaced with an Elliptical Weighted Average (EWA),
        with an ellipse (typically a circle) of the given sigma size, scaled
        according to overlay (source image) grayscale mapping.
    <br/><br/>
        As per 'Displace' and 'Distort', the red channel will modulate the
        width of the ellipse, while the green channel will modulate the height
        of the ellipse. If a single Angle value is given in the arguments,
        then the ellipse will then be rotated by the angle specified.
    <br/><br/>
        Normally the blue channel of the mapping overlay image is ignored.
        However if a second ellipse angle is given, then it is assumed that
        the blue channel defines a variable angle for the ellipse ranging from
        the first angle to the second angle given.  This allows to generate
        radial blurs, or a rough approximation for rotational blur. Or any mix
        of the two.
