This area is completely ignored by the magick script.

If you want you can put uncommented documentation such as Perl POD
which reformat such documentation into many different doc formats.
A bit like what Imagemagick does not Images!

Or you can just put any old rubbish -- much like this :-)

It could even be binary, image data or something else!
Hmmm Image Data may be useful -- perhaps in the future
Remind me sometime!
