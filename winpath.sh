# Convert the specified POSIX path to a Windows path under MinGW and Cygwin
# The optional second parameter specifies the level of backslash escaping
# to apply for each Windows backslash position in order to support varying
# levels of variable substitutions in scripts.
#
# Note that Cygwin includes the 'cygpath' utility, which already provides
# path translation capability.
