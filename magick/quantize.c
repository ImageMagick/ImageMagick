%
%  Realism in computer graphics typically requires using 24 bits/pixel to
%  generate an image.  Yet many graphic display devices do not contain the
%  amount of memory necessary to match the spatial and color resolution of
%  the human eye.  The Quantize methods takes a 24 bit image and reduces
%  the number of colors so it can be displayed on raster device with less
%  bits per pixel.  In most instances, the quantized image closely
%  resembles the original reference image.
%
%  A reduction of colors in an image is also desirable for image
%  transmission and real-time animation.
%
%  QuantizeImage() takes a standard RGB or monochrome images and quantizes
%  them down to some fixed number of colors.
%
%  For purposes of color allocation, an image is a set of n pixels, where
%  each pixel is a point in RGB space.  RGB space is a 3-dimensional
%  vector space, and each pixel, Pi,  is defined by an ordered triple of
%  red, green, and blue coordinates, (Ri, Gi, Bi).
%
%  Each primary color component (red, green, or blue) represents an
%  intensity which varies linearly from 0 to a maximum value, Cmax, which
%  corresponds to full saturation of that color.  Color allocation is
%  defined over a domain consisting of the cube in RGB space with opposite
%  vertices at (0,0,0) and (Cmax, Cmax, Cmax).  QUANTIZE requires Cmax =
%  255.
%
%  The algorithm maps this domain onto a tree in which each node
%  represents a cube within that domain.  In the following discussion
%  these cubes are defined by the coordinate of two opposite vertices:
%  The vertex nearest the origin in RGB space and the vertex farthest from
%  the origin.
%
%  The tree's root node represents the entire domain, (0,0,0) through
%  (Cmax,Cmax,Cmax).  Each lower level in the tree is generated by
%  subdividing one node's cube into eight smaller cubes of equal size.
%  This corresponds to bisecting the parent cube with planes passing
%  through the midpoints of each edge.
%
%  The basic algorithm operates in three phases: Classification,
%  Reduction, and Assignment.  Classification builds a color description
%  tree for the image.  Reduction collapses the tree until the number it
%  represents, at most, the number of colors desired in the output image.
%  Assignment defines the output image's color map and sets each pixel's
%  color by restorage_class in the reduced tree.  Our goal is to minimize
%  the numerical discrepancies between the original colors and quantized
%  colors (quantization error).
%
%  Classification begins by initializing a color description tree of
%  sufficient depth to represent each possible input color in a leaf.
%  However, it is impractical to generate a fully-formed color description
%  tree in the storage_class phase for realistic values of Cmax.  If
%  colors components in the input image are quantized to k-bit precision,
%  so that Cmax= 2k-1, the tree would need k levels below the root node to
%  allow representing each possible input color in a leaf.  This becomes
%  prohibitive because the tree's total number of nodes is 1 +
%  sum(i=1, k, 8k).
%
%  A complete tree would require 19,173,961 nodes for k = 8, Cmax = 255.
%  Therefore, to avoid building a fully populated tree, QUANTIZE: (1)
%  Initializes data structures for nodes only as they are needed;  (2)
%  Chooses a maximum depth for the tree as a function of the desired
%  number of colors in the output image (currently log2(colormap size)).
%
%  For each pixel in the input image, storage_class scans downward from
%  the root of the color description tree.  At each level of the tree it
%  identifies the single node which represents a cube in RGB space
%  containing the pixel's color.  It updates the following data for each
%  such node:
%
%    n1: Number of pixels whose color is contained in the RGB cube which
%    this node represents;
%
%    n2: Number of pixels whose color is not represented in a node at
%    lower depth in the tree;  initially,  n2 = 0 for all nodes except
%    leaves of the tree.
%
%    Sr, Sg, Sb: Sums of the red, green, and blue component values for all
%    pixels not classified at a lower depth. The combination of these sums
%    and n2  will ultimately characterize the mean color of a set of
%    pixels represented by this node.
%
%    E: the distance squared in RGB space between each pixel contained
%    within a node and the nodes' center.  This represents the
%    quantization error for a node.
%
%  Reduction repeatedly prunes the tree until the number of nodes with n2
%  > 0 is less than or equal to the maximum number of colors allowed in
%  the output image.  On any given iteration over the tree, it selects
%  those nodes whose E count is minimal for pruning and merges their color
%  statistics upward. It uses a pruning threshold, Ep, to govern node
%  selection as follows:
%
%    Ep = 0
%    while number of nodes with (n2 > 0) > required maximum number of colors
%      prune all nodes such that E <= Ep
%      Set Ep to minimum E in remaining nodes
%
%  This has the effect of minimizing any quantization error when merging
%  two nodes together.
%
%  When a node to be pruned has offspring, the pruning procedure invokes
%  itself recursively in order to prune the tree from the leaves upward.
%  n2,  Sr, Sg,  and  Sb in a node being pruned are always added to the
%  corresponding data in that node's parent.  This retains the pruned
%  node's color characteristics for later averaging.
%
%  For each node, n2 pixels exist for which that node represents the
%  smallest volume in RGB space containing those pixel's colors.  When n2
%  > 0 the node will uniquely define a color in the output image. At the
%  beginning of reduction,  n2 = 0  for all nodes except a the leaves of
%  the tree which represent colors present in the input image.
%
%  The other pixel count, n1, indicates the total number of colors within
%  the cubic volume which the node represents.  This includes n1 - n2
%  pixels whose colors should be defined by nodes at a lower level in the
%  tree.
%
%  Assignment generates the output image from the pruned tree.  The output
%  image consists of two parts: (1)  A color map, which is an array of
%  color descriptions (RGB triples) for each color present in the output
%  image;  (2)  A pixel array, which represents each pixel as an index
%  into the color map array.
%
%  First, the assignment phase makes one pass over the pruned color
%  description tree to establish the image's color map.  For each node
%  with n2  > 0, it divides Sr, Sg, and Sb by n2 .  This produces the mean
%  color of all pixels that classify no lower than this node.  Each of
%  these colors becomes an entry in the color map.
%
%  Finally,  the assignment phase reclassifies each pixel in the pruned
%  tree to identify the deepest node containing the pixel's color.  The
%  pixel's value in the pixel array becomes the index of this node's mean
%  color in the color map.
%
%  This method is based on a similar algorithm written by Paul Raveling.

%
%  ClassifyImageColors() begins by initializing a color description tree
%  of sufficient depth to represent each possible input color in a leaf.
%  However, it is impractical to generate a fully-formed color
%  description tree in the storage_class phase for realistic values of
%  Cmax.  If colors components in the input image are quantized to k-bit
%  precision, so that Cmax= 2k-1, the tree would need k levels below the
%  root node to allow representing each possible input color in a leaf.
%  This becomes prohibitive because the tree's total number of nodes is
%  1 + sum(i=1,k,8k).
%
%  A complete tree would require 19,173,961 nodes for k = 8, Cmax = 255.
%  Therefore, to avoid building a fully populated tree, QUANTIZE: (1)
%  Initializes data structures for nodes only as they are needed;  (2)
%  Chooses a maximum depth for the tree as a function of the desired
%  number of colors in the output image (currently log2(colormap size)).
%
%  For each pixel in the input image, storage_class scans downward from
%  the root of the color description tree.  At each level of the tree it
%  identifies the single node which represents a cube in RGB space
%  containing It updates the following data for each such node:
%
%    n1 : Number of pixels whose color is contained in the RGB cube
%    which this node represents;
%
%    n2 : Number of pixels whose color is not represented in a node at
%    lower depth in the tree;  initially,  n2 = 0 for all nodes except
%    leaves of the tree.
%
%    Sr, Sg, Sb : Sums of the red, green, and blue component values for
%    all pixels not classified at a lower depth. The combination of
%    these sums and n2  will ultimately characterize the mean color of a
%    set of pixels represented by this node.
%
%    E: the distance squared in RGB space between each pixel contained
%    within a node and the nodes' center.  This represents the quantization
%    error for a node.
%
%  The format of the ClassifyImageColors() method is:
%
%      MagickBooleanType ClassifyImageColors(CubeInfo *cube_info,
%        const Image *image,ExceptionInfo *exception)
%
%  A description of each parameter follows.
%
%    o cube_info: A pointer to the Cube structure.

%  GetImageQuantizeError() measures the difference between the original
%  and quantized images.  This difference is the total quantization error.
%  The error is computed by summing over all pixels in an image the distance
%  squared in RGB space between each reference pixel value and its quantized
%  value.  These values are computed:
%
%    o mean_error_per_pixel:  This value is the mean error for any single
%      pixel in the image.
%
%    o normalized_mean_square_error:  This value is the normalized mean
%      quantization error for any single pixel in the image.  This distance
%      measure is normalized to a range between 0 and 1.  It is independent
%      of the range of red, green, and blue values in the image.
%
%    o normalized_maximum_square_error:  Thsi value is the normalized
%      maximum quantization error for any single pixel in the image.  This
%      distance measure is normalized to a range between 0 and 1.  It is

%  ReduceImageColors() repeatedly prunes the tree until the number of nodes
%  with n2 > 0 is less than or equal to the maximum number of colors allowed
%  in the output image.  On any given iteration over the tree, it selects
%  those nodes whose E value is minimal for pruning and merges their
%  color statistics upward. It uses a pruning threshold, Ep, to govern
%  node selection as follows:
%
%    Ep = 0
%    while number of nodes with (n2 > 0) > required maximum number of colors
%      prune all nodes such that E <= Ep
%      Set Ep to minimum E in remaining nodes
%
%  This has the effect of minimizing any quantization error when merging
%  two nodes together.
%
%  When a node to be pruned has offspring, the pruning procedure invokes
%  itself recursively in order to prune the tree from the leaves upward.
%  n2,  Sr, Sg,  and  Sb in a node being pruned are always added to the
%  corresponding data in that node's parent.  This retains the pruned
%  node's color characteristics for later averaging.
%
%  For each node, n2 pixels exist for which that node represents the
%  smallest volume in RGB space containing those pixel's colors.  When n2
%  > 0 the node will uniquely define a color in the output image. At the
%  beginning of reduction,  n2 = 0  for all nodes except a the leaves of
%  the tree which represent colors present in the input image.
%
%  The other pixel count, n1, indicates the total number of colors
%  within the cubic volume which the node represents.  This includes n1 -
%  n2  pixels whose colors should be defined by nodes at a lower level in
%  the tree.
